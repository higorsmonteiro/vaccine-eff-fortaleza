# Estimation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Fortaleza

Scripts for the statistical analysis to estimate the effectiveness of CoronaVac in the city of Fortaleza for older 
adults (>= 60 years old).

The estimation is obtained through survival analysis over a retrospective cohort starting at the January 21th (beginning
of the vaccination campaign in Fortaleza) and ending at July 31th. Using databases of interest regarding confirmed deaths by 
Covid-19, hospitalizations and vaccination status of the population, we have selected a group of vaccinated and a group of 
unvaccinated for the follow-up matched by age and sex. Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier estimator and compared 
to obtain risk ratios.
